Estimating the parameters of a time series model can be difficult with sampling-based approaches when the model's likelihood is intractable and/or when the data set being used is large. For the Bayesian forecaster, this is the only the beginning of his problems. Once samples from a parameter posterior are obtained on a fixed data window, how will they be used to generate forecasts, and how will these parameter samples be updated as new data arrive? This paper explores 


- simple stochastic volatility model, 
- parameter filter with covariates
- pseudo-marginal MH for estimation, 
- a variety of sampling-based algorithms to generate forecasts in real time, and 
- a variety of scoring rules to compare these forecasts, and a 
- variety of ways to evaluate the uncertainty attributed to yadayada

The primary purpose of this paper is to rank forecasting algorithms, not to fit the posterior.
